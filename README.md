# Calder

Physics machine based on Alexander Calder's works.

The idea is a mobile of the type that Alexander Calder used to make. It occurred to me while I read
a story by K. Schippers in which he remembers an enormous mobile by Calder. The mobile consisted of
seven or eight half-moon shaped discs. The discs slowly moved around the museum room. At irregular
intervals they softly hit large red bowls placed on the ground. When a disc hit a bowl it would 
each time produce a different sound, depending on where and how the disc and bowl collided.

I've never seen this piece. Schippers writes he saw it at an exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in
Amsterdam. The book is from 1986, I don't know when the exhibition was.
